## üîÑ Hyperledger Fabric Integration Notes

When integrating with real Hyperledger Fabric:
1. Replace REST API calls with Fabric Gateway calls
2. Replace ledger.json with Fabric ledger queries
3. Implement chaincode functions in HerbContract.js
4. Add certificate-based identity management
5. Configure Fabric network topology

Search for `TODO: FABRIC` comments in the codebase for exact integration points.
