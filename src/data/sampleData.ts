/**
 * Instructions for Judges and Developers

 */
export const integrationInstructions = `
=== BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS ===

For production deployment with Hyperledger Fabric:

1. CHAINCODE DEVELOPMENT:
   - Replace blockchainService with actual Hyperledger Fabric SDK calls
   - Implement smart contracts (chaincode) for:
     * CollectionEvent validation and storage
     * QualityTest verification and immutable storage  
     * ProcessingStep workflow management
     * ProvenanceBundle aggregation queries

2. NETWORK SETUP:
   - Configure Hyperledger Fabric network with multiple organizations:
     * Farmer Organization (peers for collection events)
     * Lab Organization (peers for quality verification)
     * Processor Organization (peers for processing workflow)
     * Regulator Organization (oversight and compliance)

3. API INTEGRATION:
   - POST /api/farmer/collection -> fabric-network.submitTransaction('createCollection', data)
   - POST /api/lab/quality-test -> fabric-network.submitTransaction('addQualityTest', data)
   - POST /api/processor/processing -> fabric-network.submitTransaction('updateProcessing', data)
   - GET /api/provenance/:batchId -> fabric-network.evaluateTransaction('getProvenance', batchId)

4. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT:
   - Implement Hyperledger Fabric CA for user certificates
   - Replace hardcoded user IDs with actual certificate-based authentication
   - Set up enrollment and registration flows for each organization

5. SMART CONTRACT FEATURES TO ADD:
   - Geo-fencing validation using GPS coordinates
   - Seasonal harvest period validation
   - Multi-signature endorsement policies
   - Automatic compliance checking
   - Integration with IoT sensors for real-time data

6. PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Set up TLS communication between peers
   - Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
   - Add monitoring and logging infrastructure
   - Configure load balancers for high availability
   - Implement proper access controls and permissions

Current Status: ‚úÖ PROTOTYPE COMPLETE - Ready for Hyperledger Fabric integration
